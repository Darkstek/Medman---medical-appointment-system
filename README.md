# Medical Appointment System

Team project focused on building a web application for managing doctor–patient interactions.  
The application allows patients to search for doctors based on their medical needs and manage appointments through a role-based interface.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of the project was not only software development but also teamwork simulation in an agile environment.  
We practiced sprint planning, task analysis, workload distribution, and delivering a functional product according to our own design.

## Roles & Features

The system supports three main roles:

- **Patient** – selects doctors based on medical specialization and manages appointments
- **Doctor** – manages availability and patient interactions
- **Administrator** – system management and data oversight

## My Contribution

- Functional testing and system validation across modules
- Integration testing between frontend and backend components
- Bug identification and resolution support
- Feature implementation support in JavaScript (UU5 framework)
- Collaboration on sprint planning and task breakdown
- Git workflow participation (branching, merging, version control)

The project required continuous coordination with teammates and adapting to evolving requirements.

## Tech Stack

- JavaScript
- UU5 Framework
- MongoDB
- Node.js backend
- Git version control
- Agile sprint workflow

## Key Takeaways

- Working in a structured development team
- Breaking down complex tasks into manageable work items
- Testing and validating larger application architecture
- Communication within an agile environment
- Delivering a real product under time constraints

## Team Size

5 developers working in sprint-based collaboration.
